      <h4>1) Create a mathematical converter for temperature</h4>
      <p>Edit this file to provide the code that
        makes these functions work to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, and vice
        versa.&nbsp; You can test your code with the form fields below&mdash;your
        conversion code will run whenever you change the content of the input
        fields.</p>
      <p>If the user types in values that are not numbers, do nothing.</p>
      <p>Formula for converting temperature:</p>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">°C x 9/5 + 32 = °F<br>
        <br>
        (°F - 32) x 5/9 = °C</span><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; <input size="3" id="degC">°C is equal to <span class="degOutput"
        id="degFOut"></span>°F
      <br>&nbsp; <input size="3" id="degF">°F is equal to <span class="degOutput"
        id="degCOut"></span>°C
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <h4>2) Place an X in an automatically-chosen random location within a box.</h4>
      <p>Use JavaScript's random number generator,
        along with some simple arithmetic, to place an X in a box in a randomly
        chosen location. Applications of this would include placing a game
        character on the game board, or setting stars or snowflakes in a
        graphic.</p>
  <div id="putAnX">
        <div id="theX">&nbsp;</div>
      </div>
      <div id="putAnXButton" class="hwbutton">Place the X!</div>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>3. Use indexOf() and substr() or substring() to divide your name into
        two strings&mdash;firstname and lastname</h4>
    
      <p><input size="30" id="fullName"> is my full name. </p>
      <div id="splitName" class="hwbutton">Split my name!</div>
      <br>
      <span class="" id="firstname"></span> is my first name<br>
      <span class="" id="lastname"></span> is my last name<br>
      <h4>4. Write a function that will calculate the sum of the first 12 even
        Fibonacci numbers</h4>
      <p>Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is a series that begins with two
        integers: 0, 1. The next number in the sequence is derived by adding the
        previous two numbers, so the Fibonacci sequence looks like this: 0, 1,
        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The button below will run the function, called twelveEvenFibonacciSum()
        and print its result in the space provided.</p>
      <p>Use a loop that generates Fibonacci numbers. Test each one for whether it's even or odd. Sum up the even ones, counting them as you go.  Count zero as the
        first even number in the sequence.  </p>
      <div id="sumFib" class="hwbutton">Get the Sum!</div>
      <br>
      The sum of the first 12 even Fibonacci numbers is: <span class="" id="sumFibResult"></span>
      <br>

      <h4>5. Provide a feature in this page that counts the words input into the
        input box below</h4>
      The box below accepts text input from the keyboard or copy/paste.&nbsp;
      Add a feature to this page that provides an approximate
      word count for the user who's typing into the page.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
          <li>Use document.getElementById() to get the textarea element from the
            page. </li>
          <li>Write an event handler function that runs every time someone types
            in the textarea. 
          <li>Access the .value property of the textarea to get
            the contents of the box as a String</li>
          <li>Use <span style=" font-family: monospace;">String.split()</span>
            to divide the string (at word boundaries) into an array of Strings<span
              style=" font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
          <li>Count the elements in the array. This will be (roughly) the number
            of words in the box</li>
          <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">Write that value</span> into
            the HTML element that looks like this: <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;span
              id="wordcount"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Design your solution so that
          extra consecutive whitespaces are not counted. </li>
        <ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><textarea id="myWordsToCount" rows="5" cols="60"></textarea><br>
      </p>
      The wordcount is: <span id="wordcount"></span><br>
      <h4>6. Image processing (array handling) </h4>
      <p>The image below (labeled "Original") appears inside an HTML canvas element.&nbsp; Unlike an image displayed normally in
        the browser using the IMG tag, the image data that appears in a canvas
        element is available to Javascript as a "bitmap". </p>
      <p>The bitmap data is an Array that maps four numbers to each pixel in the
        image: r, g, b, a, where r, g, b are integer values from 0 to 255 which
        describe red, green, and blue respectively; and a, which is an 'alpha'
        value between 0 and 255 in which 0 is transparent and 255 is completely
        opaque. Since there are four array elements for each pixel, the total
        array will contain 4 times as many elements as there are pixels in the image. </p>
      <p>The first pixel's red data is at data[0], the second pixel's red data
        at data[4], etc. </p>
      <p>Write additional code inside the function that will
        modify the image data to create four new versions, as described below
        and in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">js/hw2ArrayImageProcessing.js</span>
        file.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>This problem is about arrays and looping and counting, not about fancy graphics-processing mathematics. Traverse the data array. This is a nine-pixel approximation of the French flag, as a bitmap.
      There are nine pixels, each with four array elements to describe their appearance, for 36 data elements in all.

      <table style="width: 100%" border="1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Original</td>
            <td>BLUE-only version</td>
            <td>Reverse-color version</td>
            <td>semi-transparent version</td>
            <td>add two images version</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><canvas id="originalCanvas"></canvas><br>
            </td>
            <td><canvas id="blueCanvas"></canvas><br>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><br>

      <p>If you've done this correctly, the table above will look something like this screengrab:
